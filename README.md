Intro

As of February 2, 2014, 
[Flappy Bird](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flappy-bird/id642099621?mt=8) 
is the top free app in the Apple App Store. I thought it'd be a fun,
short project to replicate some of the mechanics of the game in
JavaScript. 

Please note that this was only a several hour-long project, and although
I tried to keep things clean, there is some refactoring and separation
that needs to be done.
